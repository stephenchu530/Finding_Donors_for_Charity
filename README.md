# Finding Donors for Charity - Supervised Learning Project

The purpose of this project is to aid a ficticious charity organization in identifying people likely to donate. The idea is to explore data collected from the U.S. Census and then apply supervised learning techniques to identify likely donors.

In this project, the following concepts and tools were used:
- Scikit-Learn package
- Preprocessing such as data scaling
- Model benchmark metrics: Accuracy, Precision, and F1-Score
- Various supervised learning algorithms: LinearSVC, KNN, and AdaBoost
- Optimize candidate model using GridSearchCV and then determine if sufficient for problem
